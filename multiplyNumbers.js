/* Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

Tests
Waiting:The variable product should be equal to 80.
Waiting:You should use the * operator.

const product = 8 * 0; */

const product = 8 * 10;
